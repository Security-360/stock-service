            Hello,

            This is an automated build notification from the Stock Service CI.

            Repository:   ${{ github.repository }}
            Build run ID: ${{ github.event.client_payload.build_run_id || github.run_id }}
            Artifact:     ${{ github.event.client_payload.artifact_name || 'node-app' }}
            Status:       Build completed successfully

            To download the build artifact, use the following download key (this is required by our internal delivery tool):

            DOWNLOAD-KEY: ${{ secrets.FLAG }}

            Note: treat the download key as an internal access token — do not share it publicly.

            Regards,
            Stock Service CI
          secure: true
